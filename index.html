The two would huddle close as the light faded, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. <span class="human-speak">"Stay close,"</span> said <span class="playerOne"></span>, lifting up her head to peer into the dark,<br><br>

                Their hungry thirsty roots?"<br><br>
              </span>


            As if in answer, the song echoed down, encircling the girls: <span class="goblin-speak">"Come buy,"</span> heralding the weird parade of creatures that hobbled towards them in the dying light.</p>

They were unlike anything she'd ever tasted, fruits from that unknown orchard were sweeter than honey and stronger than any wine. <span class="playerOne"></span> ate until her lips were sore and face sticky from the juices, never feeling the slightest sickness despite the sheer amount she consumed.<br><br>
            Finally, not knowing if it was day or night, <span class="playerOne"></span> tossed aside the empty rinds and, on an impulse, gathered up one of the seed kernels before turning for home.</p>

            As the first snow fell, so did <span class="playerTwo"></span>, leaving her sister, <span class="playerOne"></span> bereft. On the twilight of day after her sister's death, <span class="playerOne"></span> wept by the brook where, over the rattle of her sobs, she one again caught the familiar tune. Faintly, she could hear the market-call blowing on the new winter breeze: <span class="goblin-speak">"Come buy, come buy..."</span></p>

          <h1 class="sad hide">Tragic</h1><br><br>
          <p class="sad hide">Your choices have led to a tragic end, whether due to your own curiosity or that of another. While it may have brought you here, you are among the small society who have had a glimpse into the secreted world of the Goblin Market. Few others have tasted their wares. Sometimes the desire for knowledge, to see and experience the world around us, can be harshly rewarded, but no one can say that yours is a life un-lived.</p>
          <h1 class="happy hide">Joyful</h1><br><br>
          <p class="happy hide">You made it through the Goblin Market! It wasn't easy and sometimes the circumstances took you down a dark path, but you strove to find the light: protecting your loved ones and resisting the temptation of Goblin Fruit. Take care that your devotion to steady and safe doesn't keep you from entering the woods in the first place. After all, one needs the dark to appreciate the light.</p>
