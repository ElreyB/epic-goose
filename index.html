The two would huddle close as the light faded, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. <span class="human-speak">"Stay close,"</span> said <span class="playerOne"></span>, lifting up her head to peer into the dark,<br><br>

                Their hungry thirsty roots?"<br><br>
              </span>


            As if in answer, the song echoed down, encircling the girls: <span class="goblin-speak">"Come buy,"</span> heralding the weird parade of creatures that hobbled towards them in the dying light.</p>

            Finally, not knowing if it was day or night, <span class="playerOne"></span> tossed aside the empty rinds and, on an impulse, gathered up one of the seed kernels before turning for home.</p>

The sunset threw shadows on the distant mountain crags, signaling the time for return to home and safety, but <span class="playerOne"></span> loitered and delayed.

          <h1 class="sad hide">Tragic</h1><br><br>
          <p class="sad hide">Your choices have led to a tragic end, whether due to your own curiosity or that of another. While it may have brought you here, you are among the small society who have had a glimpse into the secreted world of the Goblin Market. Few others have tasted their wares. Sometimes the desire for knowledge, to see and experience the world around us, can be harshly rewarded, but no one can say that yours is a life un-lived.</p>
          <h1 class="happy hide">Joyful</h1><br><br>
          <p class="happy hide">You made it through the Goblin Market! It wasn't easy and sometimes the circumstances took you down a dark path, but you strove to find the light: protecting your loved ones and resisting the temptation of Goblin Fruit. Take care that your devotion to steady and safe doesn't keep you from entering the woods in the first place. After all, one needs the dark to appreciate the light.</p>
